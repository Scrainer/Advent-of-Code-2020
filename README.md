# Advent-of-Code-2020
My take on the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

## What's different?
I'm going to increase the difficulty for myself by trying to code in 3 different programming languages, though I'm a busy man™. If I don't got a lot of time, my main language will be Python and I'll try to keep up to date with the other two.

- Python
- Java
- Javascript

## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!
